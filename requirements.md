# R-INTRO-TECH

Intro should describe which technology is desired for programmer to use to work with Viewzavr.

# R-PLAYER-FIRST

We should start with gui-first idea in mind. Apps/modules should not be the center of starting to create a new scene.
A new scene should be a gui-confugrable scene! This is crucual for starting for new people.
A point of start is a player. [Don't know is it a requirement or a response to it.]

# R-NO-DUPLICATE

Probably a player should not duplicate parameter values in a window hash which were not changed by user.
(e.g. load scene json -> no dup in hash).
